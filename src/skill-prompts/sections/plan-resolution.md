Run `scripts/validate-plan-blueprint.cjs <plan-id> planFile` to obtain the
absolute path of the plan file. The same script also accepts these field
names (single-field output mode) and exposes them on demand:

- `planDir` — absolute path of the plan directory
- `taskCount` — number of existing task files in that plan's `tasks/`
- `blueprintExists` — `yes` or `no`
- `taskManagerRoot` — absolute path of `<root>`
- `planId` — the resolved numeric plan ID

If the script exits non-zero, stop and ask the user to confirm the plan ID.
Do not guess a different ID.
