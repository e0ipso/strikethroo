When generating test tasks, keep this constraint:

**Definition.** Meaningful tests verify custom business logic, critical paths,
and edge cases specific to this application. Test *your* code, not the
framework or library.

**When TO write tests:**

- Custom business logic and algorithms.
- Critical user workflows and data transformations.
- Edge cases and error conditions for core functionality.
- Integration points between components.
- Complex validation logic or calculations.

**When NOT to write tests:**

- Third-party library functionality.
- Framework features.
- Simple CRUD operations without custom logic.
- Trivial getters/setters or static configuration.
- Obvious functionality that would break immediately if incorrect.

**Test task creation rules:**

- Combine related test scenarios into a single task (e.g. "Test user
  authentication flow" not separate tasks for login, logout, validation).
- Favor integration and critical-path coverage over per-method unit tests.
- Avoid one test task per CRUD operation.
- Question whether simple functions need a dedicated test task.

If any test task is generated, restate this section verbatim or near-verbatim
in that task's "Implementation Notes" so the executing agent applies it.
